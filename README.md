# fraytools-color-conflict-resolver
Small python program that aims to resolve the color conflicts that are present within Fraytools. This comes in the form off sprites having matching R,G values but not B values. Fraytools does not read B values.

# How to use:
1. Run the program via either the exe or the Python source code
2. The sprite folder needs to be populated with the path to the sprite folder. **Note** The more sprites/larger the sprites are the longer the program will take to run. Try to avoid including unnecessary sprites/pngs if possible.
3. The new sprite folder is the location for the new sprites to be moved too. **Note**  The sprite folder and new sprite folder **can be the same location**. This overwrites all sprites so back up your sprites prior to doing this.
4. Pick the .palette file that changes will be made to
5. Click the "Go" button!
6. **PROFIT**
